# Computer Vision Coursework 2
 Using ImageNet dataset to experiment different types of feature extraction methods to see the effectivity of them. Using skeleton code given by lecturer, bag of features and spatial pyramid kernels were implemented and experimented with. Using self made KNN and SVM to classify the data.

## Parts I coded
- get_spatial_pyramids.m
- nearest_neighbor_classify.m
- spatial_image_divider.m
- image_divider.m
- get_bags_of_sifts.m
- svm_classify.m
- coursework2_starter.m (structure was given to us by lecturer)
